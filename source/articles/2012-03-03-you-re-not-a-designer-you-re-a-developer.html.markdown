Don't fake it, because if you do, it shows. You often get back what you put into something, so do things properly and put some investment towards a good designer. It is money well spent. Don't on the other hand have your designer become your god, dictating your UX flow, the features you develop, etc. But that's a post (or series of posts) for another day.

Still, there are of course times when you just need to whip up a quick something. Maybe a quick splash page to gauge interest in a product or *cough* [service](http://www.soothsayerapp.com). Or perhaps a client is *really* keen on you slapping together a "quick and dirty" design for that new admin section (did you just throw up in your mouth a little, because you should have).

If you absolutely have to design something, here are some tips & tools that might be able to help out:

1. Subscribe to the RSS feeds of some design freebie sites to get some nice downloadable asset goodies like form elements, gradients, background patterns, etc. Some of my favorites are [Premium Pixels](http://www.premiumpixels.com) and [MediaLoot](http://www.medialoot.com). Hopefully you know a thing or two about Photoshop, because a lot of these resources require at least that (sometimes Illustrator too). Knowing how to navigate the interface, hide and show layers, trim transparency and export for web should take you a long way. But this ain't a tut so go look up some tuts!
2. If you're doing webby kinds of things, especially (read: only) for prototyping your newest web app, check out [Zurb Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/) (our favorite) or [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/). Again, maybe it's tempting to throw these styles up on a production site, but please don't do that lest we be faced with the "Bootstrap Web", which already appears to be happening anyway. Again, hire a designer and write some HTML/CSS. The effort shows and you might even learn something.
3. If you're clueless about color theory and stuff like I am, don't try and eyeball it. There are some pretty nice tools that help you out with picking colors for your web design that go nicely with your brand-spanking-new logo. Hit up [Kuler](http://kuler.adobe.com/). There's also a nice app on the Mac App Store called [ColorSchemer Studio](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/colorschemer-studio/id417896628?mt=12). Basically these two apps have a function where you can upload an image (like your logo or icon) and have it spit out a set of colors as a theme for you to use for your site's background and font colors.

Other tools I find useful when winging some designs:

- [ColorSnapper](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/colorsnapper/id418176775?mt=12)
- [FavIconIt](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/faviconit/id436681083?mt=12)
- [IconBox](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/iconbox/id485661828?mt=12) (where else would you keep all of your pilfered icons)?
- [Image2icon](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/image2icon/id403202957?mt=12)
- [SparkBox](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sparkbox/id488652149?mt=12)
- [LittleSnapper](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/littlesnapper/id403489261?mt=12) (a bit more full featured than SparkBox).

Good luck!

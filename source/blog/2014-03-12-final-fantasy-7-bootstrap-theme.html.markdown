I'm a huge fan of Final Fantasy 7, what self-respecting nerd isn't? I'm also a huge fan of Bootstrap. Therefore I've decided to resurrect a project I started about three years ago and never finished: The Final Fantasy 7 Bootstrap theme.

Now I'm going to be honest, I initially had been using this Bootstrap theme for the very blog you're reading right now, but quickly realized that it didn't lend itself to reading that well. Which I guess is the point of a blog. Oh well. Perhaps you can make use of it in other just-for-fun projects or applications that don't entail a lot of reading.

I should mention that it's not 100% complete, because I was only styling the elements that I was needing for my own website. I suppose if there's interest I can help out with the rest, just subscribe or leave a comment if you want me to get on it.

I thought it was pretty bad ass anyway, but maybe it's just me.

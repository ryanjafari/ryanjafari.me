# Ryan's Story

<p>

</p>

Ryan's been tinkering with technology for as far back as he can remember. From dissassembling PCs and game consoles, coding up web apps, and deconstructing viruses: the riddles of technology have long enticed him. Actually, so much so that he's been paid to solve them even before being able to legally work.

As at-home **hobbyist** turned **computer scientist** turned **back-end developer** turned **front-end developer** turned **business owner** turned **speaker/educator** turned **product manager** and **team leader**, the road has been a long one, but with a clear destination: the desire to work with humans in a world being devoured by technology; with teammates, clients, and stakeholders into delivering the very finest products backed a insatiable thirst for improving the customer experience.

At just north of ten years of professional experience in the tech industry, his career has seen him through many exciting (and challenging) experiences that have matured his perspective on people, products, and technology and the teamwork, innovation, and leadership it takes to bring them to a meaningful intersection that drives value. He has shipped scores of products: some of them successful, some of them acquired, and a lot of them that weren't.

Ryan's experience ranges from working with household brands, venture-backed startups, and tech-boom software giants. He speaks and presents at technology conferences for Fortune 500 companies, mentors aspiring software developers, and blogs about all the things.

He holds a degree in Computer Science from New York University's Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences. There he specialized in Computer Graphics, Game Design, Unix, and Database Systems.

In his spare time Ryan enjoys good food, plays video games, goes to the gym, tinkers with hardware, watches horror movies, and spends time with his high school sweetheart. He's also an aspiring game developer and world traveler. He is fascinated by the future and ponders machine learning, robotics, brain-computer interfaces, space travel, and intelligent life and their effects on life as we know it.

## What I've Learned So Far

Some highlights of his learning experience throughout the years that have informed his philosophy (some of which he has written about). He is by no means an expert in all of these things. As always, a work in-progress!

### Technical

* [Focus being able to adapt to any hot new framework (if necessary), over being wed to any single one.](/blog/2014/09/17/zurb-s-foundation-why-it-s-time-to-switch/)
* Employ a tidy git workflow and commit history policy to avoid sticky version control snafus.
* [Value code quality and pay down technical debt *(hint: it's about money).*](/blog/2014/07/16/code-quality-technical-debt-why-should-i-care/)
* Test your code: we don't need to test every single little thing, but we do need to test the right things.
* Choose the right tools for the right reasons. Try new things, but look before you leap.
* Respect constraint as a catalyst for innovation.
* [Interviewing candidates: test for talent, not for knowledge.](/blog/2016/03/07/how-i-found-myself-as-a-professional-in-the-software-technology-industry#interview)
* Hire the best: have a hiring philosophy that dictates your execution.
* Tech interviews are hard to administer (and take).

### Personal

* [Remember that if you're putting yourself outside your comfort zone, you're an imposter. And it's a good thing.](/blog/2016/03/07/how-i-found-myself-as-a-professional-in-the-software-technology-industry)
* Failure is information: it helps us understand how to do better.
* Keep calm and carry on.
* Take care of yourself: eat well and exercise.
* Sometimes your worst enemy is you.
* Patience is a virtue.
* Reflect on your biases, but first you have to know that they are biases.

### Teamwork

* Push your developers to understand the value of customer and UX driven development.
* Wear many hats if necessary, but don't wear a hat that fits someone else much better.
* Understand what needs to change when a big company swallows a small company. And what doesn't.
* Have the humility to agree to disagree, and even admit when you're totally wrong. Move quickly.
* Teaching/mentoring is a non-trivial skill to develop.
* You can't always be nice.
* Give advice to someone as close to the moment that warrants it as possible, or you risk bottling it up inside.
* Individual goals and organizational goals don't need to be at odds with one another.
* Thoughtfully delivered, radical candor with teammates can be very effective.
* Even when you think it's easy, giving and receiving feedback is hard.
* Build your team with you positioned as the servant of people who are smarter than you. Motivate/challenge them.
* Love your team. Remember to have fun when things are good (and have less when things aren't).
* Delegate well. Easier said than done, like most things, of course!
* Earn your authority and lead by influence, example, inspiration, coaching, nurturing.
* Working with code is hard, working with people is harder. Getting better at the latter helps with the former.
* Everyone you will ever meet knows something that you don't.
* Force your team to negotiate their own conflicts: don't stick yourself in the middle.
* Being a leader often means putting your feelings aside: "grinning-and-bearing" it for the greater good.

### Product

* Gather data and form a vision based on what it tells you. Be confident, but constantly re-evaluate.
* Ship early and often to your stakeholders and customers.
* Thoughtful transparency with customers can build trust, thoughtless transparency can ruin you.
* Don't let process become a proxy for the thing you want to achieve.
* When facing competition, be wary of chasing things you're not good at. Remember why your customers chose you.
* Don't be afraid to speak critically.
* Relentlessly poke holes in things.
* Relentlessly prioritize.
* Relentlessly challenge the status-quo.
* Always be thinking, but don't let over-thinking stop forward progress.
* Represent the needs of various teams in product discussions (sales, marketing, engineering, customer, executives, legal).

Just refreshing myself on some SEO duhs this morning:

- The `alt` attribute can be used to describe images, not links (where it would be invalid).
- The `alt` attribute can be used by search engines as a source of content.
- The `title` attribute can be used to provide information on where a link is going.
- The `title` attribute can be used to provide additional information for images.
- The `title` attribute is not so much used by search engines as a source of content, if at all.
- You should include your main words in both of them, but beware of keyword stuffing.
- Use descriptive image filenames in combination with descriptive image `alt` text.

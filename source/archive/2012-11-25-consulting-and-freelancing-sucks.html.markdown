Think your consulting or freelance gig sucks?

Think it's a thankless job?

Maybe you're tired of being undervalued and overworked by your clients? Perhaps you want some R-E-S-P-E-C-T for once, and want to be able to go out and afford a lunch at a trendy food truck in Manhattan?

Well.. we used to feel the same way, but then we came across the work of **Patrick McKenzie** and it changed pretty much *everything*.

The fact of the matter is, you need to go from being a coder to a consultant. Making this mental shift will help you do better work for your clients that's more focused on helping them achieve their goals, while helping you command the price tag you deserve. **Wham bam boom, everyone is happy**.

Mr. McKenzie writes some seriously great stuff, but boy does he like to write. Personally it was a lot to weed through for me considering I've only recently learned to read, but I've summarized it nicely for you below.

If you want to go more in depth and you've got some time, check out the source posts I've linked to in each section.

This guy's stuff will pretty much change your life, so get to reading and bookmarking below!

P.S. To be clear, these aren't my original ideas! All this goodness has been paraphrased as my notes from Patrick's legendary tomes, but check it out all the same!

### Don't Call Yourself a Programmer

For god's sake stop calling yourself a programmer, developer, coder, or anything else like that.

- If you are ever hired, despite what you (and even sometimes what your client thinks) you are hired to **increase revenue and reduce costs** (increase profit).
  - As a coder and a comparatively expensive resource, savvy business people are always seeking ways to replace you with cheaper alternatives. However, if instead of marketing yourself as a programmer you market yourself as a business consultant with the ability to (by developing software) increase business value, you make yourself non-replaceable!
  - When you speak to someone (anyone), describe your experience in terms of what you've done to increase revenues and reduce costs. This could mean that you helped a company with their SEO and got them more sales. If you haven't done something like this yet, describe your skills in terms of what they can do to increase this business value.
  - Let's talk about all your friends. Perhaps like mine, a lot of them are business guys. What does that even mean? We never bothered to figure it out, did we? Well a lot of those business guys, like Quantitative Analysts on Wall Street, are basically coders, but they don't describe themselves like that. Because they find other more business-y ways to describe themselves, they're making the big bucks and you're not. They say things like: "We're a multi-national conglomerate blah blah that does over 9,000 in sales per minute." instead of what you say: "I'm a Ruby on Rails developer.". Are you starting to get it?
    - And besides all that, calling yourself an XYZ programmer also automatically excludes you from a ton of jobs that aren't searching for XYZ programmers. And both you and I know that whether it's Rails or Django, it's all the same crap that can be learned in about a week. Your choice of technology stack doesn't matter a shit.

- Networking: you must, must, **must** become baller at it. It's really not that hard. Be nice and help people. If you can't help them, recommend them to someone who can. If you want to get serious, you must also be open to meeting people in person.

- Negotiating: you must become better at it. Although, never negotiate your rate, just project scope. Remember too, you're not selling the commodity of your trade anymore, you are selling the solution to a business need. This always commands more dollars (drill it in your head: increasing revenue and reducing costs).
  - Learn to say no. You'll be surprised to learn that many clients will respect this. Don't yes a client to death because you're scared they won't like your input, or you're afraid you will lose them. You're the expert here and they're paying for your expertise. Have some damn confidence man. Always negotiate a mutually beneficial offer, being sure not to side-step your own interests in the fear of losing the business.

- Equity: Don't do it.

- Communicating: **Get serious**. Your communication skills are critical. At every waking moment, be working towards ways to convey to someone that you can create value for them by, yes it's here again, increasing revenue and reducing costs. How good of a programmer you are doesn't matter at all compared to the value that what you have programmed has achieved (e.g. you've built educational software that's brought e-learning to hundreds of classrooms; that means you made someone a lot of money).

### Growing One's Consulting Business

Get a clue! Despite what you or anyone else thinks, **clients pay for business value, not coding hours and certainly not code**.

- Software and programming are tools that **help solve business problems**. You must make the mental shift to realize that business value is far more important than Ruby on Rails, node.js, or whatever other thingamabobs you all are toying with these days. Your client doesn't really give a hoot about what you code in, the tools you use, or your vast experience as a doodads developer.

- Charging: Weekly. Why? It prevents you from wasting time tracking every minute. It also helps during negotiations with clients because the conversation moves from a negotiation on rate to a negotiation on scope.

- Getting Clients: Follow every successful engagement with a case study, a testimonial, or a private referral. This stuff will help you get more business in the future. Your testimonials should be specific, focused on how you added business value for your client, and highly credible.
  - *And my own note*: From paperwork, to your website, to business cards, be professional for crying out loud. Every single thing that represents you or your business should be of impeccable quality. It goes a long way.

- Scaling: While you can hire freelancers or full-time employees, be careful to "maintain your margins" and build a cash-flow cushion. Have 30k per employee prior to scaling your next hire. As a concrete example, if you charge someone out at $4,000 a week, pay them $60 an hour.

- Building a Consultancy Alongside a Product Business: We all want to be like 37signals and Pivotal Labs. They both started out as consultancies and then went on to blow it sky-high with Basecamp and Pivotal Tracker. We all dream of working on our own product one day, and running a consultancy like these guys is one way many are getting there. Or offer training workshops. Good ways to supplement your income and take things to the next level. Of course it's true that many consultancies shut down after successfully building out their products, but isn't that a problem to have!

### Summarizing the Summary

- Stop marketing yourself as a programmer and start marketing yourself as a web business consultant.
  - Clients really care about the bottom-line: increasing revenue, decreasing expenses, or any other measurable metric which will make them money. They don't actually care how it's done (i.e. what technology is used).
  - "We solve business problems using software" is better than "We build web and mobile apps" or "We are a Ruby on Rails consultancy" because the latter puts you in the same category as all the other penny-pinching developers out there.
- The positive effects that deliverables produce is far greater than the deliverables themselves.
  - For example: "We will visually spruce up your website and add X, Y, & Z features" vs. "We will increase the traffic to your website by 20% by visually improving the calls to action and making the site more Google-friendly".
- Case studies: They should focus less on the features or work that was done versus what the end result was for your client. Just as is suggested when writing a resume, showing the value of what you did is far more important than just describing it.
- Your rate should be tied to the value that you are providing
  - If a $1 million per year revenue company gets 10% more conversions from the work you did, then that's $100,000 of value added, regardless of how long the work takes (even if it's only 1 week's worth of work).

And that's it. Cheers all!

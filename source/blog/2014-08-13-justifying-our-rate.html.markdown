Ever shopped around and found that costs for getting an app built are all over the place? Offshore developers can promise *the same web app* for as little as $1000 and big web firms can go all the way up into the millions. What the heck is going on here?

Putting dollar values to the side for just a moment, there are really big differences from one provider to the other in terms of the level of service you'll be getting. The most important thing for you to do is figure out your needs. Then, and only then, can you choose who is right for you (and how much it will cost).

If you base your decision solely on budget, you're bound to not get what you want (and you'll waste what budget you do have). It happens *all* the time.

So, how do you know what freelancer or company is right for you? Carlos and I have drawn up a chart that will help you make the decision.

And a little context: we're friendly with "competitors" both big and small. From solo freelancers, to offshore teams, to huge development firms. Our aim was to make this analysis as neutral as possible, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of each option (including our own company) to equip you with unbiased information to make a decision with.

Use the chart above to align yourself with a particular web development shop
type: a big firm, a high-quality freelancer, or a potentially cheaper offshore
team, based on what's most important to you. Further, know if who you work with
understands and is committed to delivering what you define as success for your
project: be it a financial return on investment, making you look good to investors,
or helping you build and get acquired as fast as possible.

### In The Beginning

It all started from a conversation I was having with my cousin at a now demolished Greek takeout restaurant. Over a chicken gyro (you know, the one with the weird flat meat), I spoke to Carlos about the web stack I was working with at my current job: all-in Microsoft with IIS, MSSQL, and ASP.NET C#. I had just been working with it for a little over a year, but already I was eager for something new. At the time, Rails was beginning to gain traction through the successes of Basecamp and 37signals, and the evangelizing of the founder of Rails, David Heinemeier Hansson.

"Have you heard of this thing Ruby on Rails?" I asked him. "Mm, yeah something. It's this new framework everyone is talking about. I don't know, maybe it's legit." he said. "What if we started our own business, and did everything on Rails?" I proposed. Yeah, I said it just like that.

We started to eat up books like *Rework,*  *Remote: Office Not Required,* and *Getting Real* (co-authored by DHH) since they offered a breath of fresh air when it came to the long-standing and seldom challenged productivity structures we were just settling into a few years out of college. In fact, the entire DHH marketing engine worked its wonders on us: books, seminars, and articles later and our work and development philosophies started to evolve. DRY became a central pillar of our development doctrine. Less is more became our mantra. We began to think that maybe distributed teams could be a real thing; we could not find a compelling reason why we couldn't work from wherever we wanted, whenever we wanted. Why not "work less" when we can achieve in 4 hours what someone else does in 8?

We experimented a lot. We learned a lot (but had, and still have, a long way to go).

As you can see, what on the surface seemed like a chance to play with a new tech toy, was actually something more profound. We didn't realize it yet, but Rails was really a proxy for embarking on new adventure, second guessing the status quo, and exploring ourselves as a team and as individuals. Who were we? Were our goals separately the same as our goals as a team? Could we squeeze more out of work and life, prioritizing working smarter over working harder? Could we do our own thing, and get paid for it?

And thus, **Ryan & Carlos** was born.

### Getting to Work

For us, Rails went from trendy, anti- big Microsoft tool built by our messiah DHH to ideal choice for our client base and our small-team, agile workflow. We would go on to make hundreds of thousands of dollars whipping up apps and features that met business needs with Rails, exclusively for startups. Our customer ranged from a jewelery maker with a $1,500 budget to big VC-backed operations with millions to spend.

Our team consisted of at least Carlos and myself, at most one designer (usually overseas), and a local developer or two. As a distrbuted team, we usually worked remotely from our clients, although a big part of our value proposition (we learned) was our highly consultative approach, white glove service, and smiling faces. To this end, in-person meetings were common, where we'd join the client with their team at their premsises, perhaps hanging out for the day.

#### What We Did

Between the two of us, we covered everything for 20+ clients over 6 years. Let's see, that amounts to meaningful amounts of:

- Business development (e-mail outreach, cold calls, networking, events...)
- Content marketing (blogging, e-mail campaigns, whitepapers...)
- Vendor management (hosting, marketing, legal, accounting, business filing...)
- Consulting (proposals, project roadmaps...)
- Paperwork (agreements, statements of work, invoicing...)
- Developer operations (DNS, hosting, git, APIs...)
- Product management (Agile: Pivotal, JIRA, stand-ups, retros...)
- Development (front-end, back-end; you know, the actual work!)
- Recruiting efforts (internally, and externally to help our clients)
- New products/services ideation

### What We Worked On

Our engagements usually lasted from ~3 months to at most 2 and change years. With some of those lengither engagements, we developed strong bonds and lifetime friends (in fact, I write this on the eve of the bachelor party weekend of one of our former clients)! We also learned, that with many of them, these bonds were only as strong as the structure that defined them from the outset...

### Setting Expectations & Keeping Clients Happy

When we set out on this business, we were very self-centered: what did we want to offer? When did we want to work? Who did we want to work with? How much would we get paid, and when? How would we protect ourselves?

One of the (few) positive side effects of our self-centered business beginnings was the fact that we became very tight with our contracts very quickly: developing thorough and fair master services agreements and statements of work right from the get-go. We invested a lot of time and money on research and materials to that end, and as a result we seldom if ever had a problem where things went south due to a poor contract. That's not to say things didn't ever go south.

Sometimes, no matter how well expectations were set, we would come to the end of a project (according to the letter of the statement of work) and the client would not be happy. Initially this confused the hell out of us: they wanted X, and we delivered X (usually ahead-of-schedule and always on-budget), but they weren't completely satisfied. This just didn't add up in our rational programmer minds: they wanted us to do more work, but for the same amount of money? Absurd!

It was only then, when we started learning about customer service & satisfaction. Things like under-promising and over-delivering, the value of a well-placed freebie, and generally making a customer feel like they are getting more than they pay for. That behavioral economics is a real field (actually one I did work in back in college, shame on me), and that people often behave emotionally when it comes to financial transactions.

This process transformed (matured) the way we would work with and treat our customers from then on. We leveled up from "meeting our end of the bargain" to "doing whatever it takes" to satisfy the customer, placing the burden solely on us to figure out how, if the customer wasn't satisfied, we'd come up with creative ways to make that happen efficiently, yet to maximum effect.

### Highlights

Ryan & Carlos took us to some fun places and introduced us to loads of tremendous people. Here are a few memories from those times & travels, and please excuse the fact that I am a careless photographer:

### Scaling The Business

Typically we would either be helping entrepreneurs get their product off the ground, or augmenting a client's current team. As questions of scaling our business emerged, it became clear our clients were purchasing *us* and then to a slightly lesser extent our expertise and experience. As many business owners face at some point, we had countless intense discussions about how to separate ourselves from our offerings, since consulting began to exhaust our energies. We explored and tried our hand at scaling our team, licensing software, maintenance services, a la carte consulting offerings, publishing e-books, and finally, software-as-a-service. While we learned *a ton* during these adventures, all of our efforts to separate our time from the rate at which we made money failed.

### Crossroads

We finally took some time to take a step back to answer for ourselves: what did each of us really want? We had a lot of discussions around this, and it turns out the answer was different for each of us. We both enjoyed different things about the Ryan & Carlos collaboration, among them work-life balance, running a business, working with entrepreneurs, and building new and early-stage product.

We loved working together, but the grind of consulting work started to take some of the fun out of that. For this reason, we decided to indefinitely suspend the consulting arm of Ryan & Carlos, and allow ourselves to explore these other parts of it we loved individually to make a living, while waiting for the next big opportunity for us to collaborate again. As of right now, there's no plan, but we've got lots of ideas for changing the world!

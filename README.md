Always in-progress.

## What is this?

The personal website, blog, and portfolio of Ryan Jafari.

## Notable tech involved

[Middleman](http://middlemanapp.com/) makes static websites really boss: this entire website is generated on my local machine by Middleman from Markdown files, ERB & Slim templates, and Ruby code before being synced with Amazon S3 via the great (middleman-s3_sync)[https://github.com/fredjean/middleman-s3_sync].

This results in a simple, clean, super fast, super available, and easily maintainable yet customizable personal web presence for yours truly.

And that's pretty much it.

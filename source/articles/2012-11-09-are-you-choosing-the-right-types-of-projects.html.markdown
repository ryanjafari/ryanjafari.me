Cetrasoft is nearing its 2 year anniversary as a web consultancy, and over the past couple of years we have had the pleasure of working with a wide variety of people. Our clients have run the gamut from large, 200-person corporations to single-person startups. During this time, we began to notice that certain _kinds_ of projects went smoothly, while others did not.

In an effort to make some sense out of our experiences and to improve my web consulting business overall, I started reading [_Managing the Professional Service Firm_](http://www.amazon.com/Managing-The-Professional-Service-Firm/dp/0684834316) by David H. Maister. In the book, he outlines 3 different areas that a firm can specialize in and the implications of each on all things ranging from what kinds of employees to hire, what your rate should be, to how to market yourself.

The basic gist is that identifying which area you excel at and choosing your projects to be in alignment with your specialty will keep you from attracting the wrong kind of clients and setting yourself up for eventual hardship and/or failure.

### Areas of Specialization

According to Maister, there are three key benefits that a client seeks when choosing a service firm to handle his/her project. These are _expertise_, _experience_, and _efficiency_. These benefits are not mutually exclusive, however certain types of projects will require placing a higher priority on one above the others.

These principles apply to all types of service firms, however I’ll be describing it in the context of a web developer or web consultancy. Here we go...

#### Expertise

If a project seems super complicated or requires solving a complex problem using cutting edge technology, then it probably falls into the expertise category. This is a job for someone with a Computer Science PhD; only the brainiest and most talented individuals will do. The result is a completely customized solution, which perhaps yields new frameworks, protocols, or methodologies in the process. Optimization, performance, and scaling (remember ["Big O notation"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation)?) are probably quite important.

Many startup projects fall into this category as they intend to “disrupt” their respective industries with innovative and novel applications (although that [isn’t the only way to do it](http://37signals.com/svn/posts/3302-competing-on-easy_)). As you’ll see below, startup projects are particularly troublesome given their requirements versus their resources.

#### Experience

If you find yourself adapting a tried-and-true solution to fit a new situation, then you might be looking at an “experience” project. For these project types, your team’s collective experience is more valuable than any individual person’s, and any prior work on other projects of a similar type is a huge advantage.

I believe that my own consultancy excels at this category of project. While I consider myself a fairly good programmer and have engineered some pretty cool technology for past projects, I haven’t found myself rewriting any internet protocols lately. I enjoy applying the tools in my toolkit to the task at hand instead of trying to invent the wheel each time, and I think a framework like Rails was made to serve this exact purpose.

#### Efficiency

Assuming you aren’t a developer savant, if you can complete a project from start to finish in just a few days, then that project has to fall into the “efficiency” category. Anyone with a basic amount of web development knowledge and experience should be able to handle these projects, and output is the name of the game.

CMS-based projects or static websites are good examples of these kinds of projects. Although the design and content will vary, they are fairly straightforward to implement without a lot of customization. Because these types of projects are so programmatic, it’s no surprise that there exist many website-builder applications which automate this process (taking developers out of the equation altogether)!

### Implications

Let’s view the overall characteristics of each category on a spectrum

And here is a chart of implications which follow directly from those characteristics

#### Pricing and Volume

Now the million dollar question: how much should I charge for my services? The answer is obvious to us developers, but perhaps the explanation will help you justify the cost to your clients.

On the far left side of the spectrum, we have the highly customized projects requiring senior level developer talent. These kinds of projects should command higher rates because of the expertise involved and the lack of qualified individuals (low supply) who can perform the work. Because of the higher rates, a lower volume of these projects is sustainable.

On the opposite end, we have the efficiency projects. Because there are many qualified people to handle these, there’s a lot more competition, and a client is likely to choose whoever can do it the quickest and the most cost-effectively. Fixed-rate pricing schemes are likely to be advantageous on this end of the spectrum, but you’ll have to strive for high volume.

One mistake my own consultancy made with regards to pricing was trying to do fixed-rate schemes for projects on the wrong end of the spectrum! As a result there were frequent disagreements over what was in versus out of scope, what changes could be made, and the deadline for the project completion. Trying to anticipate all of the needs of a custom development project and adding tons of constraints to a Statement of Work made us less agile and left both the client and ourselves unhappy.

#### Staffing

The staffing implications are pretty straight-forward: For expertise projects, more senior- than junior-level developers are necessary. For experience projects, a balanced mix of developers is needed as the senior-level developers provide mentorship as the junior-level developers gain experience. For efficiency projects, more junior-level developers should be utilized over senior-level developers.

#### Marketing

The main way to attract expertise projects is to highlight the capability and talent of your employees. Perhaps there is some all-star member of your team with a cryptic alias such as “DHH” and his abilities prove to be a big selling point for clients. For clients seeking the technical expertise of a business, it’s much less about the business itself than the individual members inside the organization.

Conversely, experience and efficiency projects draw on the collective knowledge of the individual members of a firm, therefore individual members need not be as highly visible as the firm itself.

Additionally, someone seeking efficiency projects might do well to market themselves as a “product.” I knew a developer who created his own CMS module and marketed custom websites using his CMS as if it were a stand-alone product. He was able to offer fast turnaround, and low cost-- the hallmarks of an efficiency business.

### On startups

As I have alluded to throughout this post, my company hasn’t had great success working with startups, and hopefully you can see why. Startup projects usually present _amazing_ opportunities to create truly groundbreaking software (expertise projects), however, unless they are funded, they generally don’t have “expertise-level” money to back them. This means that developers will either be underpaid, or the project will suffer. Investment money, crowd-sourcing, and sweat equity are ways around the problem, but I think it might just be the case that startups and consultancies are not well suited for each other.

### Conclusion

So now we know to organize our business for each type of project. If you are already in alignment or if you thought this was all painfully obvious, then kudos to you! If not, then you have two options: (1) change your structure to attract the kind of projects you want to get or (2) start selecting the kinds of projects which better suit the structure you already have.

It’s important to remember that most clients are not going to necessarily know which type of project they have, _especially_ the web world. It’s up to us to figure out this information and be more selective about the kinds of projects we take on and the kinds of clients we engage with.

## ...and vanquished imposter syndrome

### A major (career) change

I was a sophomore majoring (poorly) in psychology, and generally struggling to find myself in late teens/early twenties: What did I want to be when I grew up? What was I good at?

Well, I thought, in high school I was an athlete, artist, musician, and an "A" student. Things were easy: just be pretty good at everything right? Sounds like the ideal high school student, but as college majors and career brainstorming came around, I asked myself: am I a "jack-of-all trades and a master of none?"

Who would realistically pay me, out of college, for a career in being pretty good at a lot of things? I knew the world wasn't designed that way, but how the heck was I supposed to pick one thing to do for the rest of my life? Seemed incredibly limiting to me... I liked doing a lot of different things with a lot of different people: I thrived on this.

I imagine a lot of high schoolers and early-college students contend with this existential crisis. And not to mention those much later on in their careers.

I knew what my parents wanted me to be: lawyer, doctor, other some-such professional... it was a sure way to financial stability. So, I took the pre-med plunge my freshman year, and yeah, they weeded me out with an absolutely obscene amount of chemistry homework. I was miserable. I didn't want to be a doctor this bad: I was still just trying to be a good boy and do what my parents wanted me to do.

Enter the psych. major. I've heard it joked that people who didn't know what they wanted to do in college chose psychology. For many, including my lovely girlfriend of more than the last decade, this isn't true.

But for me, it was.

### I was scared of math and science

As I floundered, shuffling my feet to each class, I did a lot of introspection: forget what I was good at, what did I love? The answer was easy.

Electronics, gadgets, machines... computers. How that came to be is a story for another day, though!

So why didn't I just major in computer science/engineering from the start? Like far too many students in our countries' education system, I was scared of math and science and knew these subjects were a large part of those majors. Although I maintained advanced placement in math throughout school, it didn't come easy to me. It was hard. It took a lot of effort, and many of the teachers I'd had over the years weren't supportive: "You'll never score well on the NY state regents" one middle school math teacher told me in front of the whole class. It was from that day I decided to double-down, but you can see how this could play out in a very different way.

Despite the personal victory of working hard to do well on that regents and beyond, college maths still scared me. The events that precipitated my momentous decision are now lost to history, but it was one day that I decided: "Screw it. Whatever I'm doing isn't working. I've no passion and no direction. I need to do something different. I want to try to be a programmer."

And thus I allowed myself to open a new door that would change my life forever, but it wasn't easy!

### Learning programming concepts was hard

While comp sci 101 went easy enough, things started to get really hard for me in 102. My professor breezed through classes, objects, polymorphism, and inheritance: uh... what? I'll never forget that moment I had in class, staring into space, where I put it all together. What an "aha!" moment that was, but it took me some time to get there compared to my classmates, or so it seemed.

Then came machine language and later, operating systems. On a final assignment in an exercise in paging, I spent a week in my dorm room, in the dark, pizza boxes everywhere, trying to get my algorithm to work correctly while performing efficiently. After days of struggle I called out to classmates for help. However, it was every person for themselves!

I didn't end up doing well on the assignment, despite all the effort, yet it's one of the best things that ever happened to me: a great "failure" that resulted in one of the greatest successes in my life: learning to be okay with struggle and a humbling blow to my ego. Learning of "failure" as simply: information.

In the end, I skated by that challenge, but it was on to the next one.

### Looking for work

My first "real" job came as a programmer for the economics department at my school, helping graduate students program software for their theses. After that, onto an entry-level software engineer position at an agency. It was after a few years of plugging away on web apps that I began to think:

I loved technology, and programming was fun, but did I love working as a programmer? Would I want to do this for the rest of my life? Was there a way out? I knew I was innately much more of a social person than I'd become in my new career: I wanted to see and meet people, discuss and relate about technology. [What to do?](https://www.kennorton.com/essays/productmanager.html)

Well, I needed money and I knew how to code things, so I started hustling for freelance gigs. Eventually, after a few years of hustling for well under market rate even for an entry-level programmer, to build my portfolio up, something started to take shape. These efforts turned into a collaboration with my cousin (also a developer) and eventually our Ruby on Rails consultancy called "Ryan & Carlos."

R&C was a big personal success, because I was able to take myself out of back-of-house software development and work more face-to-face with clients, stakeholders, and even manage other developers and designers. It was the breath of fresh air my career needed for sure. It was taxing as hell: business development, hiring and placement, finances, taxes contracts, meetings, estimates, invoicing, deadlines, user stories, wireframes, dev ops, code reviews... and of course actually having to code myself, which had to happen at some point: usually late night. A grueling, but immensely rewarding experience I wouldn't trade in for anything, but at over 6 years in it was time to think about the next move.

### A switch to education

I began to reflect on the portion of my career I enjoyed the most up until this point: at a high level this was showing people how technology influences and has the potential to better our life. A bit lower, this meant showing clients how to make technology work efficiently for them and their businesses, and developers how to be both better at code, and more importantly how to make code better for them. Sparing the details, I began a couple roles at companies that worked towards these ends. This is where I'm at now, and I'm happy to be here.

In short, I've made (and am making) this industry my own through continuous self-exploration. Becoming a programmer was an important first step in building credibility in the tech industry, but from there my career has taken turns based on different things I've wanted to try. As the years go by, my career grows more and more focused: more and more my own.

### But enough about me, what about you?

If you read it, I provided the above anecdote to give supplemental context and also encouragement for you, the reader, to make a change in your life. If you didn't, that's great also! The point is this:

*Whether you're meant to be a programmer or not (and whatever that means): the tech industry is burgeoning with all kinds of jobs, and it can be argued that anyone working at a company who builds software should have some level of understanding of the work product their company is responsible for producing. Whether acquired beforehand or on-the-job, I certainly believe this to be true.*

If you're looking towards any career in this industry, learning programming can't hurt, but it's an investment (time, money, or both). For those who are thinking about taking the plunge, some words for the hesitant:

#### I want to be a programmer

Learning to program probably won't be easy, but it is absolutely possible.

It's often said that anything worth doing is usually hard. I think this is mostly true when it comes to work.

It wasn't easy for me. But everyone is different, and everyone learns differently. Let's face it. In fact, that's a great thing. Myself? It takes me a while to learn new concepts, especially ones of a technical nature. But I like to think that for those people, once they do grasp something, they're solid.

I say probably won't be easy (as opposed to definitely won't be easy) just because some just pick things up quicker than others it seems. Like a classmate of mine in "Intro to Computer Graphics" ...

> Me: "Did you do the homework?"

> Apparent Genius: "Yeah!"

> Me: "Was it easy?"

> Apparent Genius: "Not too bad."

> Me: "Have you done this kind of programming before?"

> Apparent Genius: "No."

"Not too bad." was very challenging for me. Maybe he was a liar though, who knows. It was definitely discouraging at the time, but you've got to accept yourself for who you are and how you learn. It's then you can start to break down once insurmountable barriers.

Most classes I took I felt like an impostor, feeling like I was pretending to be good at something I was not (yet) good at. This was tough, but I had to press on, and you have to as well.

<a name="interview"></a>

##### The interview: bad ones look for knowledge, good ones look for talent

When you're ready to attack your new career head-on and start taking interviews, you'll begin realizing something very important:

(Most) technical interviews aren't conducted very well. I know this 1st hand because I've been on many, 2nd hand because I've coached folks through them, and 3rd hand because of the horror stories.

Many dread the technical interview. I know I do. Still. But sometimes it can feel like it's taboo in the developer community to say or let on that you feel that way.

I'm not going to go into better interviewing techniques, since it's out of the scope of this post, but the gist is that crappy interviews test for knowledge, while better ones test for talent. Unfortunately, seemingly many fail in this regard. Why is that? Testing for knowledge is easy, while testing for talent takes a bit more work. Here's an example:

- Test for knowledge: "Talk about JavaScript's .prototype."
- Test for talent: "Pick a native object in JavaScript and extend/customize it for me."

The test for knowledge is the easy way out for the interviewer. Just sit back, see if it seems like the interviewee knows what they are talking about, and check off the box. The test for talent takes more time to think about and contrive, may take more to explain, and assessing it is harder.

You can't control how the interview is administered, only your responses to what you are asked. Assessing hard skills is important, and different interviewers will try to assess them in different ways. Some general advice:

- Go on lots of interviews; practice makes perfect.
- Get passionate: talk to them about your work.
- Hone your approach to problem solving; articulate it verbally and in code.
- Be upbeat and positive! Nobody wants to buy a sad puppy.
- Demonstrate how you will  help solve the problems of your co-workers and the business.
- Ask for feedback from the interviewer on how they think you did.

To this day, I feel (most times, irrationally) like an impostor on these tests. So you're not alone, believe me.

##### It will take more than just programming skills to succeed

What many need to remember is that you need to connect with people as much as you can, first and foremost. Connect with them, have a two-way conversation with them, ask them about themselves, make them feel good, and make them like you. People want to work with people, and even if you're behind a screen most of the time, you still need to have a baseline level of emotional intelligence. I don't think that's to say everyone has to completely change their personality, but understanding, compromise, and sensitivity are critical in a workplace setting.

Envision the typical image of the programmer/hacker. Ok, you see this person now? Chances are, this person is not a very good communicator. And a such I'd argue they wouldn't make a good addition to today's technology workplace, whatever their credentials might be. This stereotypical image of the programmer has changed and is changing drastically today. With the many Computer Science in school initiatives and coding academies around, I am positive in the not-too-distant future everyone will have a programming background of some kind, in addition to whatever other background they might have...

Also remember: you're you. More often than not, this means you have an edge you might not think matters. For example, I love telling stories: I'm a highly regarded storyteller among my friends. How can I leverage this to my advantage? I'll let you think on that, but don't be afraid to show off what makes you, you. Remember that lots of people can code, but there's only one you that can code!

Maybe you're coming from another industry? I've always been jealous of folks who have backgrounds in literature, art, business, finance, etc. that jump into the world of technology. They have  domain knowledge they can fuse with software to really innovate.

If you're coming from a career in something else you feel is unrelated, don't ever look at it as something to leave behind. In fact, it's more related than you might think in a world where every single industry and discipline now touches technology in some way. Hold on to it, cherish it, apply and incorporate it. It makes you more unique and appealing as a candidate.

...and for those still on the fence about being a programmer...

#### I think I want to be a programmer

What if you're not totally sure being a programmer is right for you? That it might not work out, whatever the reason? Realize this:

Learning to program makes you an impressive candidate for so many roles in so many industries. You arm yourself with knowledge of one of the most coveted skills in the world today. That makes you pretty dangerous! Some positions that can benefit from a good dose of programming knowledge:

- Product manager
- Dev ops
- Designer
- UX/UI specialist
- Support engineer
- Solutions architect
- QA engineer
- ...even software sales (isn't it good to know what goes into what you're selling?)

Either way, go for it. You stand to gain so much. Whether you take being a programmer all the way to senior engineer and director of technology or CTO, or pivot to something else along the way, follow the itch and your gut. It'll take you places you couldn't dream of.

I personally found that I liked to program, but I also wanted to work in other capacities too, like on the business side, in education, and even public speaking. It took me a while to realize that was OK.

In conclusion: everyone's got a different journey. If you're thinking about learning code, try it, but stay true to yourself and make it your own. Don't just grind for a paycheck: you'll perform worse and be miserable. Instead, put your whole self into it and watch as opportunity starts taking shape!

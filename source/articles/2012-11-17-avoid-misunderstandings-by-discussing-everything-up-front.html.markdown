As our consultancy has evolved, we’ve found it more and more beneficial to be up front with our clients about _all_ things regarding the working relationship right from the get-go. Many of the problems we have experienced in the past were actually just misunderstandings. Neither party was right or wrong, it was just that each had differing expectations. We’ve learned to avoid this kind of situation by making sure that everyone is on the same page _before_ starting any work.

Here are some topics to discuss with your clients to make sure any potential issues can be smoothed out before the contracts are signed and the work begins.

### Availability

When can the client expect you to be available? On a daily basis? Are weekends off-limits?

As freelancers and business owners, we value the flexibility to make our own hours, but most clients don’t have the same freedom. They may want to schedule meetings and  expect you to respond to their emails/phone calls during times when you aren’t available.

Rather than leaving them in the dark, try to coordinate a specific time of the day when you can be available to each other to answer questions, discuss issues, and give project status updates. Lay out a schedule from the very beginning so that the client doesn’t have to hunt you down.

### Communication

How can the client get in touch with you? Do you prefer emails over conference calls? Will you do in-person meetings?

Some clients will be fine with virtual forms of communication, but others will prefer phone calls or face-to-face meetings. You certainly don’t want to end up flagging a client’s calls or making up excuses for why you can’t meet with him/her. As with your availability, it’s best to lay some ground rules beforehand so everyone knows what to expect.

### Payment Terms

What forms of payment do you accept? How often do you send invoices and how soon thereafter do you expect them to be paid?

Discussing payment terms can be uncomfortable, and the topic may seem premature to bring up before you’ve even secured the job, but once the project is underway, you definitely don’t want there to be _any_ roadblocks preventing you from getting paid.

Ask the client how his/her accounting department works. Some businesses only cut checks for contractors once a month. Other clients may want to pay by credit card or wire transfer, in which case certain fees will apply. It’s in your best interest to know these details in advance so you aren’t left trying to pay your bills with money that hasn’t arrived yet.

### Conclusion

It may be tempting to try and secure the job first and worry about these details later. I’m sure many feel that these issues will sort themselves out during the course of the project. But bringing up these topics right from the start will help uncover any potential sources of conflict that could arise, and gives you the chance to work them out earlier, rather than later. Once work has started or money has changed hands, it becomes much harder to deal with these issues, and you may find yourself in an uncomfortable situation where one or both parties ends up unhappy.
